	<div class="boxone"><br><span class="four">In this paper presentation, Dr. Baudry will describe a clinical entity in which a primitive core is hidden behind what looks like a neurotic organization. In order to reach this core usual analytic attempts to search for meaning fail as the pathology of a traumatic nature occurs mostly during the pre-verbal period. Sensitivity to severe agonies, fear of disintegration and of falling apart, communication through action, and a greater reliance on counter-transference and on the repetition of traumatic scenarios in the analytic room need to be identified and managed. Three clinical vignettes will illustrate the challenging therapeutic task.</span></div>

	<div class="boxone"><br><span class="five">Francis Baudry, M.D. is a Training and Supervising Analyst at New York Psychoanalytic Society & Institute. He has a special interest in a wide range of analytic theories including Kleinian, French (especially the work of Andr√© Green), and South American.
