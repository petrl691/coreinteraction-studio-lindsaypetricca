		New York, May 11, 2011 The directors of
		The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art announced
		today that their boards of trustees have agreed in principle to a multiple-year  collaboration projected to begin in 2015,when the Whitney opens its new museum facility on Gansevoort Street in downtown Manhattan.The Metropolitan Museum plans to present exhibitions and educational programming at the Whitney’s landmark building at 945 Madison Avenue, which was designed by Marcel Breuer, for a period of eight years, with the possibility of extending the agreement for a longer term.The two museums will seek to collaborate on collections sharing,publications, and other educational activities.

		Adam D. Weinberg, the Whitney’s Alice Pratt Brown Director, said:“We are thrilled at the prospect of this long-term collaboration with the Met. Throughout our planning for the Whitney’s new building downtown we have committed ourselves to finding a distinguished museum partner for the Breuer building in keeping with its iconic stature. The Met is ideal in so many ways. I am sure that Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who initially offered her collection of American art to the Met before deciding to found the Whitney Museum, would be delighted that we are embarking on this unprecedented collaboration. We could not have found a better collaborator with respect to our beloved Breuer building while we re-establish our presence downtown, blocks from the Whitney’s original building in Greenwich Village. In the meantime, our vibrant program
		of exhibitions and events will continue in the Breuer building over the course of the next four years.”

		On behalf of the Metropolitan Museum, Director Thomas P. Campbell said: “We are extremely pleased to be able to enter into this collaboration. With this new space, we can expand the story that the Met tells, exploring modern and contemporary art in a global context that reflects the breadth of our encyclopedic collections. This will be an initiative that involves curators across the Museum, stressing historical connections between objects and looking at our holdings with a fresh eye and new perspective. This project does not mean that we are taking modern and contemporary art out of the Met’s Main Building, but it does open up the possibility of having space to exhibit these collections in the event that we decide to rebuild the Lila Acheson Wallace Wing where they are currently shown. The Whitney will open its new location in 2015, so I look forward to developing our ideas around this project in the intervening years. It is an amazing opportunity, filled with possibilities for our art and our audience.”

Bloomberg. “Even after the Whitney opens its new downtown home, the historic Breuer building will continue to serve as an exceptional venue for exhibitions, lectures, and gallery tours, benefiting the millions of New Yorkers and visitors from around the world who enjoy world-class arts programming.”
