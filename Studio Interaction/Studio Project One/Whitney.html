<div class="box" id="boxleft"><div class="paraone"><span class="staff"><a href="http://whitney.org/About/Bios">Adam D. Weinberg</a></span>, the Whitney’s Alice Pratt Brown Director, said: “We are thrilled at the prospect of this long-term collaboration with the <span class="met"><a href="Met.html">Met</a></span>. Throughout our planning for the Whitney’s new building downtown we have committed ourselves to finding a distinguished museum partner for the <span class="breuer"><a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/the-met-breuer">Breuer building</a></span> in keeping with its iconic stature. The Met is ideal in so many ways. I am sure that Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who initially offered her collection of American art to the Met before deciding to found the Whitney Museum, would be delighted that we are embarking on this unprecedented collaboration. We could not have found a better collaborator with respect to our beloved Breuer building while we re-establish our presence downtown, blocks from the Whitney’s original building in Greenwich Village. In the meantime, our vibrant program of exhibitions and events will continue in the Breuer building over the course of the next four years.”</div></div>

<div class="box" id="boxmiddle"><div class="paratwo">On May 24, the Whitney will break ground on a 200,000-square-foot building, designed by architect <span class="RenzoPiano"><a href="http://whitney.org/About/NewBuilding">Renzo Piano</a></span>. Located in the Meatpacking District on Gansevoort Street, bordered by the Hudson River and the High Line, the building will provide the Whitney with essential new space for its <span class="collection"><a href="http://collection.whitney.org/artists/by-letter/A">collection</a></span>, <span class="exhibit"><a href="http://whitney.org/Exhibitions">exhibitions</a></span>, and <span class="edu"><a href="http://whitney.org/Events?view=month&start=2016-02-22&event_category_id=226">education</a></span> and <span class="perform"><a href="http://whitney.org/Events?view=month&start=2016-02-22&event_category_id=390">performing arts programs</a></span> in one of New York’s most vibrant neighborhoods.</div></div>

<div class="box" id="boxmiddleright"><div class="parathree">The Whitney Museum of American Art is the world’s leading museum of twentieth-century and contemporary art of the United States. Focusing particularly on works by living artists, the Whitney is celebrated for presenting important exhibitions and for its renowned collection, which comprises over 18,000 works by more than 2,800 artists. With a history of exhibiting the most promising and influential artists and provoking intense debate, the <span class="biennial"><a href="http://whitney.org/Exhibitions/2014Biennial">Whitney Biennial</a></span>, the Museum's signature exhibition, has become the most important survey of the state of contemporary art in the United States. In addition to its landmark exhibitions, the Museum is known internationally for events and educational programs of exceptional significance and as a center for research, scholarship, and conservation.</div></div>


<div class="box" id="boxright"><div class="parafour">
Founded by sculptor and arts patron <span class="gv"><a href="http://whitney.org/About/History"></a></span>Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney in 1930, the Whitney was first housed on West 8th Street in Greenwich Village. The Museum relocated in 1954 to West 54th Street and, in 1966, inaugurated its present home, designed by Marcel Breuer, at 945 Madison Avenue on the Upper East Side. While its vibrant program of exhibitions and events continues uptown, the Whitney is moving forward with a new building project, designed by Renzo Piano, in downtown Manhattan. Located at the corner of Gansevoort and Washington Streets in the Meatpacking District, at the southern entrance to the High Line, the new building, which has generated immense momentum and support, will enable the Whitney to vastly increase the size and scope of its exhibition and programming space. Ground will be broken on the new building in May 2011, and it is projected to open to the public in 2015.
